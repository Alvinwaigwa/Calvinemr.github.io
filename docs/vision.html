      <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
      <p>Nursing students often enter clinical practice with theoretical knowledge but limited experience with digital
        health systems. This gap can lead to inefficiencies and errors when they encounter real EMR software. Our team’s
        project, Calvin EMR simulation, addresses this by providing a realistic training environment for our nursing
        program students. We will build on previous years of student work by adding more features as requested by the
        nursing department and developing a large collection of end-to-end tests of the software. This will allow
        nursing students to practice patient data management and EMR navigation without risking actual patients.</p>

      <p>We also work to make the codebase clean, testable, stable, and maintainable. For this year, we aim to produce a
        quality tool that helps students learn and can be adapted and possibly productized. The project is designed for
        longevity: clear documentation, automated tests, and an approachable structure to make future student teams
        productive quickly.</p>

      <h3>Normative & Ethical Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Appropriateness:</strong> Design with cultural and clinical context in mind; keep nurses' workflows
          central.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear UI and informative errors so learners understand system behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Caring:</strong> Keep patient data personable (notes, profile photos) to support compassionate care
          training.</li>
      </ul>
