      <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
      <p>Nursing students often enter clinical practice with theoretical knowledge but limited experience with digital
        health systems. This gap can lead to inefficiencies and errors when they encounter real EMR software. Our team’s
        project, Calvin EMR simulation, addresses this by providing a realistic training environment for our nursing
        program students. We will build on previous years of student work by adding more features as requested by the
        nursing department and developing a large collection of end-to-end tests of the software. This will allow
        nursing students to practice patient data management and EMR navigation without risking actual patients.</p>

      <p>We also work to make the codebase clean, testable, stable, and maintainable. For this year, we aim to produce a
        quality tool that helps students learn and can be adapted and possibly productized. The project is designed for
        longevity: clear documentation, automated tests, and an approachable structure to make future student teams
        productive quickly.</p>

      <h3>Normative & Ethical Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Appropriateness:</strong> Technology products should consider the culture into which they are
          embedded, cultivating improvement without disrespectful or unnecessary disruption.
          <br><em>Consequences if ignored:</em> We may fail to account for features nursing students need.
          <br><em>Remedy:</em> Stay in contact with nursing professors for features and proper terminology.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Technology ought to be understandable by the user, so they recognize
          potential dangers and can diagnose failures. For example, software and dashboards that clearly communicate
          status and errors.
          <br><em>Consequences if ignored:</em> The product may be hard or unpleasant to use.
          <br><em>Remedy:</em> Add informative errors and maintain an intuitive UI.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Caring:</strong> Designs should help serve one another, promote wellness, contribute to healing,
          show love to neighbors, and enable creatures to flourish.
          <br><em>Consequences if ignored:</em> Patients may feel like data points rather than people.
          <br><em>Remedy:</em> Make patient data personable with notes and profile photos.
        </li>
