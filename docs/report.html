      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>This project is a multi-year initiative between Calvin's Computer Science and Nursing departments to build an
        Electronic Medical Record (EMR) simulator for nursing students. The project evolved through successive teams;
        the Class of 2022 built the foundation, Class of 2024 improved usability and medication dispensing integration,
        and Class of 2025 expanded clinical assessments and PDF generation.</p>

      <h2>Recent Work</h2>
      <p>Our recent work includes getting development environments working and improving the Pediatric Assessment
        module. We forked and cloned the repository, ran the application locally, and implemented improvements to the
        pediatric form such as reordering fields and modifying age input logic based on patient type. Concurrently, we
        expanded the automated test suite to cover authentication, patient creation workflows, and patient list
        management.</p>

      <h3>Product Success Criteria</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>New features do not break existing functionality.</li>
        <li>Regular interaction with the nursing department to ensure feature alignment.</li>
        <li>A growing suite of tests to prevent regressions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Development Process</h3>
      <p>Using GitHub Flow: fork, feature branches and pull requests to a staging branch, weekly meetings with advisors,
        and each member contributing ~6 hours/week.</p>

      <h3>Updates Since Milestone 2</h3>
      <p>Added more assessment tests, features for adding a single student, sharing patients with administrators, and
        changes based on professor feedback.</p>

      <h3>Individual Contributions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Peter</strong>: Completed tests for the assessment form and implemented assessment changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Alvin</strong>: Added patient sharing and single-student addition features.</li>
      </ul>
