      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>This project is a multi-year initiative between Calvin's Computer Science and Nursing departments to build an
        Electronic Medical Record (EMR) simulator for nursing students. The project evolved through successive teams;
        the Class of 2022 built the foundation, Class of 2024 improved usability and medication dispensing integration,
        and Class of 2025 expanded clinical assessments and PDF generation.</p>

      <h2>Recent Work</h2>
      <p>This semester, we focused on setting up development environments and improving the Pediatric Assessment module.
        We forked and cloned the repository, ran the application locally, and implemented improvements to the pediatric
        form such as reordering fields and modifying age input logic based on patient type. We also expanded the
        automated test suite to cover authentication, patient creation workflows, and patient list management.
        Additionally, we added features for sharing patients with administrators and adding individual students, and
        made changes based on professor feedback.</p>

      <h3>Product Success Criteria</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>As we develop new features, we don't break existing ones.</li>
        <li>We interact with the nursing department regularly to ensure our implementation meets their needs.</li>
        <li>We develop a set of tests to ensure the product does not regress.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Development Process</h3>
      <p>Our team has successfully established our development workflow. We are using GitHub Flow, forking the main
        repositories, working on feature-specific branches, and submitting Pull Requests to the staging branch for peer
        review. We hold a weekly working meeting with our advisor and communicate regularly to coordinate efforts. Each
        member consistently dedicates 6 hours per week to the project.</p>

      <h3>Semester Work</h3>
      <p>This semester, we refined our vision and success criteria based on feedback. We implemented the Pediatric
        Assessment feature, established an automated testing framework using Playwright, added new features like sharing
        patients and adding individual students, and expanded tests for assessments.</p>
